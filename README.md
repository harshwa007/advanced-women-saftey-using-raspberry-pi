Introduction:

Women’s safety has become an increasingly important issue in modern society. With the rise in the number of crimes against women, there is a need for advanced technological solutions that can help ensure their safety. The Raspberry Pi is a popular single-board computer that has been used to develop a variety of projects. In this project, we will discuss the development of an advanced women’s safety system using Raspberry Pi, GPS sensor, pulse sensor, and Pi camera.

Background:

The Raspberry Pi is a small, credit card-sized computer that can be used for a wide range of applications. It has become popular among hobbyists, educators, and developers for its low cost and versatility. The Pi camera is a high-quality camera module that can be attached to the Raspberry Pi to capture images and videos. The GPS sensor can be used to track the location of an individual, while the pulse sensor can be used to monitor the heart rate.

Design and Implementation:

The advanced women’s safety system is designed to be compact and portable, so that it can be easily carried around by women. The system consists of a Raspberry Pi, GPS sensor, pulse sensor, and Pi camera. The GPS sensor is used to track the location of the user, while the pulse sensor is used to monitor their heart rate. The Pi camera is used to capture images and videos of the surroundings.

The system is designed to be activated by the user in case of an emergency. The user can activate the system by pressing a button on the Raspberry Pi. Once activated, the system will start capturing images and videos using the Pi camera. It will also start tracking the location of the user using the GPS sensor. The pulse sensor will monitor the heart rate of the user.

If the heart rate of the user exceeds a certain threshold, the system will alert the user that they may be in danger. The system will also send an alert message to a designated emergency contact, along with the current location of the user. The emergency contact can then take appropriate action to ensure the safety of the user.

Conclusion:

The Raspberry Pi based advanced women’s safety system is an innovative solution that can help ensure the safety of women. The system is portable, easy to use, and can be activated in case of an emergency. The GPS sensor, pulse sensor, and Pi camera work together to provide accurate location tracking and heart rate monitoring. The system can send alerts to a designated emergency contact, which can help ensure a quick response in case of danger. With further development and testing, this system could become a valuable tool in the fight against crimes against women.
